= Spring Boot Camel Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka Quickstart

=== Preparing the Kafka instance

The quickstart can run with any Kafka instance. However we want to focus
how to connect a Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka to Camel.
In order to use it, you must login to the
https://cloud.redhat.com/beta/[Red Hat Cloud (Beta)]. Please, consider
the due https://access.redhat.com/articles/5979061[limitations] of this
offering at the time of writing this tutorial.

==== Create an instance and a topic

In order to setup an instance and your first topic, you can follow up
the
https://cloud.redhat.com/beta/application-services/streams/resources?quickstart=getting-started[UI
quickstart] or use the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_streams_for_apache_kafka/1/guide/f520e427-cad2-40ce-823d-96234ccbc047[rhoas
CLI].

____
*Note:* we assume in this tutorial that you are creating a topic named
`test`. You can use any other name, just make sure to reflect the name
chosen in the `application.properties` configuration file.
____

==== Prepare Kafka credentials

Once youâ€™ve setup your first topic, you must create a set of credentials
that you will be using during this quickstart:

* https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_streams_for_apache_kafka/1/guide/f351c4bd-9840-42ef-bcf2-b0c9be4ee30a#_7cb5e3f0-4b76-408d-b245-ff6959d3dbf7[Create
a service account via UI]
* https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_streams_for_apache_kafka/1/guide/f520e427-cad2-40ce-823d-96234ccbc047#_5199d61c-8435-45b0-83f2-9c8c93ef3e31[Create
a service account via CLI].

At this stage you should have the following credentials: a
`kafka bootstrap URL`, a `service account id` and a
`service account secret`.

=== Standalone

This example demonstrates using the camel-kafka component with Red Hat
Fuse on Spring Boot to produce and consume kafka messages.

In this example, a Camel route produce at a fixed rate of 5s, String
messages that are sent to kafka. A second route is subscribed to the
kafka topic and print out the messages received.

=== Prerequisites

* Maven
* Configured kafka instance, topic and credentials on RHOSAK
* A java version that support TLS 1.3 protocol, eg. from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u261-relnotes.html[Oracle JDK 8u261-b12] or https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8245466[AdoptOpenJDK 8u272-b10] or java 11 (`fuse-java-openshift-jdk11-rhel8` image is used to build in java 11).


=== Running the example

To run the example

[arabic]
. Change your working directory to `resources` directory.
. edit `application.properties` with parameters from RHOSAK, in particular:
+
[source,java-properties]
----
## Modify value of <FILL_ME> before running application
kafka.brokers = <FILL_ME>
# Service Account info
sa.client.id=<FILL_ME>
sa.client.secret=<FILL_ME>
----

==== Running the example on Red Hat Fuse Standalone
. Build the project
+
....
 mvn clean package
....

. Start the fat jar
+
....
 mvn spring-boot:run
....
+
In the logs, you should see somethig like this:
+
....
2021-06-04 12:27:04.807  INFO 1106408 --- [aConsumer[test]] kafka-consumer                           : Greetings at fixed rate

....

==== Running the example on Openshift
IMPORTANT: You need to run this example on Container Development Kit 3.3 or OpenShift 3.7.
Both of these products have suitable Fuse images pre-installed.
If you run it in an environment where those images are not preinstalled follow the steps described in <<single-node-without-preinstalled-images>>.


To deploy this quickstart to a running OpenShift cluster:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the quickstart:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Change the directory to the folder that contains the extracted quickstart application (for example, `my_openshift/spring-boot-camel-rhosak`) :

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd my_openshift/spring-boot-camel-rhosak
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests oc:deploy -Popenshift
----

. List all the running pods:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get pods
----

. Find the name of the pod that runs this quickstart. Output the logs from the running pods and see the messages sent by Camel:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc logs <name of pod>
----

[#single-node-without-preinstalled-images]
=== Running the Quickstart on a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster without preinstalled images

A single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

If you have a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your quickstart there.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the quickstart:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Import base images in your newly created project (MY_PROJECT_NAME) according to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_fuse/7.10/html/fuse_on_openshift_guide/get-started-non-admin[documentation].

. Change the directory to the folder that contains the extracted quickstart application (for example, `my_openshift/spring-boot-camel-rhosak`) :
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd my_openshift/spring-boot-camel-rhosak
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests oc:deploy -Popenshift -Djkube.generator.fromMode=istag -Djkube.generator.from=MY_PROJECT_NAME/fuse-java-openshift:1.10
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `spring-boot-camel-rhosak` has started up.

. On the project's `Overview` page, navigate to the details page deployment of the `spring-boot-camel-rhosak` application: `https://OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR:8443/console/project/MY_PROJECT_NAME/browse/pods/spring-boot-camel-rhosak-NUMBER_OF_DEPLOYMENT?tab=details`.

. Switch to tab `Logs` and then see the messages sent by Camel.
